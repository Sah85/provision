Digital Rebar Provision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*simple, fast and open API-driven server provisioning.*

**DR Provision** is a `APLv2 <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalrebar/provision/master/LICENSE>`_ simple Golang executable that provides a simple yet complete API-driven DHCP/PXE/TFTP provisioning workflow system.

Simply, Digital Rebar Provisioner acts as a Cobbler replacement - with additional powerful per-machine workflow provisioning capabilities.
