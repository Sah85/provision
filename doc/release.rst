Releases

Version Scheme
--------------

There are two named releases and many semantic versioned releases.

* **tip** - This is the currently built master code.  It follows the bleeding edge of the trees.
* **stable** - This is the default release used by install.  It follows to most recently released code.

The other releases follow the v<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch> format.  e.g. **v3.0.0**

The :ref:`rs_install` process will default to **stable** but can be modified to use other releases.

Docs are also generated for these as well.

The full version string generated by the build tool looks like this:

* v3.0.0-tip-galthaus-dev-19-d012b1d6ba892c96c81c24ee93b668591663ca5c
* v3.0.0-tip-16-e1fa235dc28f7d278bc34a0d4db87c306d9d3ba8
* v3.0.0-0-821108c416dfc1486919baa52dae284975d2ad8b

The base form is base semver tag, extra pieces, gits ahead of that base, and the actual git commit checksum.

The extra pieces is either -tip to indicate that the build comes from the tip of the tree or
-tip-<username>-dev where the username is who built the custom build that is ahead of tip at the time.

The *dr-provision* server reports its version on start-up or can be queried by running:

  ::

    dr-provision --version

The *drpcli* client reports its version by running:

  ::

    drpcli version


Release Process
---------------

The team will regularly move the **tip** tag to track the leading edge of the **master** branch.  This will make
the resulting build available in the `releases <https://github.com/digitalrebar/provision/releases>`_ tab.

Additionally, as releases cut at stable points, the **stable** tag will be set to the new most recent milestone.
Release notes and comments will be added to the github release page.

Release Notes
-------------

Each of the release specific changes are annotated in the Release Notes documentation.  You can find the release notes
