FAQ / Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section is designed to answer frequently asked questions and help troubleshoot Digital Rebar Provision installs.

Want ligher reading?  Checkout our :ref:`rs_fun`.

.. _rs_bind_error:

Bind Error
----------

Digital Rebar Provision will fail if it cannot attach to one of the required ports.

* Typical Error Message: "listen udp4 :67: bind: address already in use"
* Additional Information: The conflicted port will be included in the error between colons (e.g.: `:67:`)
* Workaround: If the conflicting service is not required, simply disable that service
* Resolution: Stop the offending service on the system.  Typical corrective actions are:

  * 67 - dhcp.  Correct with `sudo pkill dnsmasq`

See the port mapping list on start-up for a complete list.

.. _rs_gen_cert:

Generate Certificate
--------------------

Sometimes the cert/key pair in the github tree is corrupt or not sufficient for the environment.  The following command can be used to rebuild a local cert/key pair.

  ::

    sudo openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes

It may be necessary to install the openssl tools.

.. _rs_add_ssh:

Add SSH Keys to Authorized Keys
-------------------------------

VIDEO TUTORIAL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StQql8Xn08c

To have provisioned operating systems (including discovery/sledgehammer) add SSH keys, you should set the ``access-keys`` parameter with a hash of the desired keys.  This Param should be applied to the Machines you wish to update, either directly via adding the Param to the Machines, or by adding the Param to a Profile that is subsequently added to the Machines.  NOTE that the ``global`` Profile applies to all Machines, and you can add it to ``global`` should you desire to add the set of keys to ALL Machines being provisioned.

The below example adds *User1* and *User2* SSH keys to the profile *my-profile*.  Change appropriately for your enviornment.

  ::

    cat << END_KEYS > my-keys.json
    {
      "Params": {
        "access-keys": {
          "user1": "ssh-rsa user_1_key user1@krib",
          "user2": "ssh-rsa user_2_key user2@krib"
        }
      }
    }
    END_KEYS

    drpcli profiles update my-profile -< keys.json

.. _rs_access_ssh_root_mode:

Set SSH Root Mode
-----------------

The Param ``access-ssh-root-mode`` defines the login policy for the *root* user.  The default vaule is ``without-password`` which means the remote SSH *root* user must access must be performed with SSH keys (see :ref:`rs_add_ssh`).  Possible values are:

========================  ==========================================================
value                     definition
========================  ==========================================================
``without-password``      require SSH public keys for root login, no forced commands
``yes``                   allow SSH *root* user login with password
``no``                    do not allow SSH *root* user login at all
``forced-commands-only``  only allow forced commands to run via remote login
========================  ==========================================================


.. _rs_autocomplete:

Turn on autocomplete for the CLI
--------------------------------

The DRP CLI has built in support to generate autocomplete (tab completion) capabilities for the BASH shell.  To enable, you must generate the autocomplete script file, and add it to your system.  This can also be added to your global shell ``rc`` files to enable autocompletion every time you log in.  NOTE that most Linux distros do this slightly differently.  Select the method that works for your distro.

You must specify a filename as an argument to the DRP CLI autocomplete command.  The filename will be created with the autocomplete script.  If you are writing to system areas, you need ``root`` access (eg via `sudo`).

For Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS distros:
  ::

    sudo drpcli autocomplete /etc/bash_completion.d/drpcli

For Mac OSX (Darwin):
  ::

    sudo drpcli autocomplete /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/drpcli

Once the autocomplete file has been created, either log out and log back in, or ``source`` the created file to enable autocomplete in the current shell session (example for Linux distros, adjust accordingly):
  ::

    source /etc/bash_completion.d/drpcli

NOTE:  If you receive an error message when using autocomplete similar to:
  ::

    bash: _get_comp_words_by_ref: command not found 

Then you will need to install the ``bash-completion`` package (eg. ``sudo yum -y install bash-completion`` or ``sudo apt -y install bash-completion``).


.. _rs_more_debug:

Turn Up the Debug
-----------------

To get additional debug from dr-provision, set debug preferences to increase the logging.  See :ref:`rs_model_prefs`.

.. _rs_vboxnet:

Missing VBoxNet Network
-----------------------

Virtual Box does not add host only networks until a VM is attempting to use them.  If you are using the interfaces API (or UX wizard) to find available networks and ``vboxnet0`` does not appear then start your VM and recreate the address.

Virtual Box may also fail to allocate an IP to the host network due to incomplete configuration.  In this case, ``ip addr`` will show the network but no IPv4 address has been allocated; consequently, Digital Rebar will not report this as a working interface.

.. _rs_debug_sledgehammer:

Debug Sledgehammer
------------------

If the sledgehammer discovery image should fail to launch Runner jobs successfully, or other issues arise with the start up sequences, you can debug start up via the systemd logging.  Log in to the console of the Machine in question (or if SSH is running and you have ``access-keys`` setup, you can SSH in), and run the following command to output logging:
  ::

      journalctl -u sledgehammer


.. _rs_convert_to_production_mode:

Convert Isolated Install to Production Mode
-------------------------------------------

There currently is no officually supported *migration* tool to move from an ``Isolated`` to ``Production`` install mode.  However, any existing customizations, Machines, Leases, Reservations, Contents, etc. can be moved over from the Isolated install directory structure to a Production install directory, and you should be able to retain your Isolated mode environment.

All customized content is stored in subdirectories as follows:

  Isolated: in ``drp-data/`` in the Current Working Directory the installation was performed in
  Production:  in ``/var/lib/dr-provision``

The contents and structure of these locations is the same.  Follow the below procedure to safely move from Isolated to Production mode.

#. backup your current ``drp-data`` directory (eg ``tar -czvf /root/drp-isolated-backup.tgz drp-data/``)
#. ``pkill dr-provision`` service
#. perform fresh install on same host, without the ``--isolated`` flag
#. follow the start up scripts setup - BUT do NOT start the ``dr-provision`` service at this point
#.  copy the ``drp-data/*`` directories recursively to ``/var/lib/dr-provision`` (eg: ``unalias cp; cp -ra drp-data/* /var/lib/dr-provision/``)
#. make sure your startup scripts are in place for your production mode (eg: ``/etc/systemd/system/dr-provision.service``)
#. start the new production version with  ``systemctl start dr-provision.service``
#. verify everything is running fine
#. delete the ``drp-data`` directory (suggest retaining the backup copy for later just in case)

.. note::  WARNING:  If you install a new version of the Digital Rebar Provision service, you must verify that there are no Contents differences between the two versions.  Should the ``dr-provision`` service fail to start up; it's entirely likely that there may be some content changes that need to be addressed in the JSON/YAML files prior to the new version being started.  See the :ref:`rs_upgrade` notes for any version-to-version specific documentation.


.. _rs_kickseed:

Custom Kickstart and Preseeds
-----------------------------

Starting with ``drp-community-content`` version 1.5.0 and newer, you can now define a custom Kickstart or Preseed (aka *kickseed*) to override the defaults in the selected BootEnv.  You simply need to only define a single Param (``select-kickseed``) with the name of the Kickstart or Preseed you wish to override the default value.
  ::

    export UUID="f6ca7bb6-d74f-4bc1-8544-f3df500fb15e"
    drpcli machines set $UUID param select-kickseed to "my_kickstart.cfg"

Of course, you can apply a Param to a Profile, and apply that Profile to a group of Machines if desired.

.. note:: The Digital Rebar default kickstart and preseeds have Digital Rebar specific interactions that may be necessary to replicate.  Please review the default kickstart and preseeds for patterns and examples you may need to re-use.   We HIGHLY recommend you start with a `clone` operation of an existing Kickstart/Preseed file; and making appropriate modifications from that as a baseline.


.. _rs_download_rackn_content:

Download RackN Content via Command Line
---------------------------------------

If you need to download RackN content requiring authentication, you can do this via the command line by adding Auth Token to the download URL.  Your Auth Token is your RackN UserID (UUID) found after logging in to the `RackN Portal User Management panel <https://portal.rackn.io/#/user/>`_.

Here is an example download using our Auth Token, and using the Catalog to locate the correct download URL based on our DRP Endpoint OS and Architecture:
  ::

      # Set our RACKN_AUTH token to our UUID
      export RACKN_AUTH="?username=<rackn_username_uuid>"

      # set our DRP OS and ARCH type
      export DRP_ARCH="amd64"
      export DRP_OS="linux"

      # set our catalog location
      PACKET_URL="https://qww9e4paf1.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/main/catalog/plugins/packet-ipmi${RACKN_AUTH}"

      # obtain our parts for the final plugin download
      PART=`curl -sfSL $PACKET_URL | jq -r ".$DRP_ARCH.$DRP_OS"`
      BASE=`curl -sfSL $PACKET_URL | jq -r '.base'`

      # download the plugin - AWS cares about extra slashes ... blech
      curl -s ${BASE}${PART}${RACKN_AUTH} -o drp-plugin-packet-ipmi


.. _rs_update_content_command_line:

Update Community Content via Command Line
-----------------------------------------

Here's a brief example of how to upgrade the Community Content installed in a DRP Endpoint using the command line.  Please note that some RackN specific content requires authentication to download, while community content does not.   See :ref:`rs_download_rackn_content` for additional steps with RackN content.

Perform the following steps to obtain new content.

View our currently installed Content version:
  ::

    $ drpcli contents show drp-community-content | jq .meta.Version
      "v1.4.0-0-ec1a3fa94e41a2d6a83fe8e6c9c0e99c5a039f79"

Get our new version (in this example, explicitly set version to ``v1.5.0``.  However, you may also specify ``stable``, or ``tip``, and do not require specific version numbers for those.
  ::

    export VER="v1.5.0"
    curl -sfL -o drp-cc.yaml https://github.com/digitalrebar/provision-content/releases/download/${VER}/drp-community-content.yaml

It is suggested that you view this file and ensure it contains the content/changes you are expecting.

Now update the content.

.. note:: Content that is marked *writable* (field ``"ReadOnly": false``) may need to be destroyed, and recreated if it's currently in use on other objects.  For *read only* content you can safely update the content.

  ::

    $ drpcli contents update drp-community-content -< drp-cc.yaml
      {
        "Counts": {
          "bootenvs": 7,
          "params": 18,
          "profiles": 1,
          "stages": 13,
          "tasks": 7,
          "templates": 15
      <...snip...>

Now verify that our installed content matches the new vesion we expected ...
  ::

    $ drpcli contents show drp-community-content | jq .meta.Version
      "v1.5.0-0-13f1aff688b53d5dfdab9a1a0c1098bd3c6dc76c"


.. _rs_nested_templates:

Nested Templates (or "Sub-templates")
-------------------------------------

The Golang templating language does not provide a call-out to include another template.  However, at RackN, we've added the ability to include *nested templates* (sometimes referred to as *sub-templates*).  In any content piece that is valid to use the templating capabilities, simply use the following Template construct to refer to another     template.  The template referred to will be expanded inline in the calling template.  The nested template example below calls the template named (oddly enough) *nested.     tmpl*.
  ::

    {{template "nested.tmpl" .}}

    # or alternatively:

    {{$templateName := (printf "part-seed-%s.tmpl" (.Param "part-scheme")) -}}
    {{.CallTemplate $templateName .}}

The ``template`` construct is a text string that refers to a given template name which exists already.

The ``CallTemplate`` construct can be a variable or expression that evaluates to a string.


.. _rs_change_machine_name:

Change a Machines Name
----------------------
If you wish to update/change a Machine Name, you can do:
  ::

    export UUID="abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst"
    drpcli machines update $UUID '{ "Name": "foobar" }'

.. note:: Note that you can NOT use the ``drpcli machines set ...`` construct as it only sets Param values.  The Machines name is a Field, not a Parameter.  This will NOT work: ``drpcli machines set $UUID param Name to foobar``.

.. _rs_reservation_set_hostname:

Set `hostname` in a DHCP Reservation
------------------------------------

If you create a DHCP Reservation for a system (or convert an active Lease to Reservation), you can also set the Hostname for the Machine.  If you are pre-creating Reservations, this will allow you to have a pre-set hostname when the Machine first comes up.  Additionally, if you create/destroy your machine objects, but would like a hostname to persist with the Machine Reservation when the machine returns, you can do this. 

.. note:: The UX version (at least as of v1.2.1 and older) does not support setting DHCP options to the Reservation.  You will have to perform these actions using either the CLI or API.  The CLI method is outlined below.

This procedure assumes you have a Reservation created already, and we are going to update the existing Reservation.  You can combine this procedure with creating a new Reservation, but only if you perform the operation via the CLI or API.

  ::

    # show the current Reservation:
    drpcli reservations show 192.168.8.100

    # create a Hostname specification in the DHCP Options section of the reservation:
    drpcli reservations update 192.168.8.100 '{ "Options": [ { "Code": 12, "Value": "pxe-client-8-100" } ] }'

In the above exmaple, we are assuming our DHCP Reservation is for a Reservation identified by the IP Address ``192.168.8.100``, and that we are setting the hostname (DHCP Option 12) to ``pxe-client-8-100``.


.. _rs_uefi_boot_option:

UEFI Boot Support - Option 67
-----------------------------
Starting with v3.7.1 and newer, a DHCP Subnet specification will try to automatically determine the correct values for the ``next-server`` and *DHCP Option 67* values.  In most cases, you shouldn't need to change this.  Older versions of DRP may need the ``next-boot`` and/or the *DHCP Option 67* values set to work correctly.  This is especially true of Virtualbox environments prior to v3.7.1.  You will need to force the *DHCP Option 67* to ``lpxelinux.0``.

The DHCP service in Digital Rebar Provision can support fairly complex boot file service.  You can use advanced logic to ensure you send the right PXE boot file to a client, based on Legacy BIOS boot mode, or UEFI boot mode.  Note that UEFI boot mode can vary dramatically in implementations, and some (sadly; extensive) testing may be necessary to get it to work for your system.  We have several reports of field deployments with various UEFI implementations working with the new v3.7.0 and newer "magic" Option 67 values.

Here is an example of an advanced Option 67 parameter for a DHCP Subnet specification:

  ::

    {{if (eq (index . 77) "iPXE") }}default.ipxe{{else if (eq (index . 93) "0")}}lpxelinux.0{{else}}bootx64.efi{{end}}

If you run in to issues with UEFI boot support - please do NOT hesitate to contact us on the `Slack Channel <https://www.rackn.com/support/slack>`_ as we may have updated info to help you with UEFI boot support.

An example of adding this to your Subnet specification might look something like:
  ::

    # assumes your subnet name is "eth1" - change it to match your Subnet name:
    # you may need to delete the existing value if there is one, first, by doing:
    # drpcli subnets set eth1 option 67 to null # The setting to null is not needed with v3.7.1 and beyond.
    drpcli subnets set eth1 option 67 to '{{if (eq (index . 77) "iPXE") }}default.ipxe{{else if (eq (index . 93) "0")}}lpxelinux.0{{else}}bootx64.efi{{end}}'

.. _rs_lpxelinux_no_such_file:

lpxelinux.0 error: no such file or directory
--------------------------------------------

After TFTPing lpxelinux.0, logs (or network packet traces) may show an error similar to:
  ::

    477    0.378296662    10.10.20.76    10.10.31.96    TFTP    159    Error Code, Code: 
    File not found, Message: open /var/lib/dr-provision/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/16089a59-9abd-48c2-850a-2ac3bc134935: no such file or directory``

This is expected behavior that is standard PXE *waterfall* searching for a valid filename to boot from.  For full reference, please see the `syslinux <http://www.syslinux.org/>`_ reference documentation, at:

    http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=PXELINUX#Configuration

The expected behavior is for a client to attempt to download files in the following order:

    #. client id (DRP does not use this option, which is what generates the error)
    #. mac address (in the form of ``01-88-99-aa-bb-cc-dd``)
    #. ip  address in uppercase Hexadecimal format, stepping through IP, subnet, and classful boundaries
    #. fall back to the default defined file

Due to this behavior, filenames will be specified that do not exist, and the error message related to that probe request is a normal message.  This is NOT an indicator that provisioning is broken in your environment.


.. _rs_render_kickstart_preseed:

Render a Kickstart or Preseed
-----------------------------

Kickstart and Preseed files only created by request and are not stored on a filesystem that is viewable.  They are dynamically generated on the fly, and served from the virtual Filesystem space of the Digital Rebar HTTP server (on port 8091 by default).  However, it is possible to render a kickstart or preseed to evaluate how it is going to operate, or troubleshoot issues with your config files. 

When a machine is in provisioning status, you can view the dynamically generated preseed or kickstart from the TFTP server (or via the HTTP gateway).  Provisioning status means the Machine has been plaed in to an installable BootEnv via a Stage.  If (for exaxmple) placed in to ``centos-7-install`` Stage, the ``compute.ks`` can be rendered for the machine.  Or, if placed in to ``ubuntu-16.04-install`` Stage, the ``seed`` can be rendered for the machine.  

Get the Machine ID, then use the following constructed URL:
  ::

    MID="7f65279a-7e5c-4e69-af40-dd01af4c5667"
    DRP="10.10.10.10"
    TYPE="seed"   # seed for ubuntu, or compute.ks for centos

    http://${DRP}:8091/machines/${MID}/${TYPE}


Example URLs:

  ubuntu/debian:
    http://10.10.10.10:8091/machines/7f65279a-7e5c-4e69-af40-dd01af4c5667/seed

  centos/redhat:
    http://10.10.10.10:8091/machines/7f65279a-7e5c-4e69-af40-dd01af4c5667/compute.ks

.. note:: A simple trick ... you can create a non-existent Machine, and place that machine in different BootEnvs to render provisioning files for testing purposes.  For example, put the non-existent Machine in the ``centos-7-install`` Stage, then render the ``compute.ks`` kickstart URL above.


.. _rs_kubernetes_dashboard:

Kubernetes Dashboard
--------------------

The Ansible Kubespray and the Kubeadm deployments of Kubernetes are all maintained by the respective Kubernetes communities.  Digital Rebar simply implements a basic version of those configurations.  Access to the Kubernetes Dashboard is often changing, and being updated by the community.  Please check with the respective communities about how to correctly access the Dashboard.   

Some things to note in general: 

  * Access is restricted; as well it should
  * You must configure/enable access to the Dashboard
  * Our implmentations usually have a mechanism configured, but this changes over time
  
Some things that have worked in the past:

  * ``kubectl proxy`` - enabled Proxy access to the Kubernetes Master to get to the Dashboard
  * try stopping the Proxy container, and running ``kubectl proxy --address 0.0.0.0 --accept-hosts '.*'``
     * carefully consider this implication - you are enable access from all hosts !!! 
  * any other solutions, please let us know... we'll add them here 


.. _rs_expand_templates:

Expand Templates from Failed Job
--------------------------------

If you have a task/template that has failed, once it's been run by the Job system, you can collect the rendered template.  The rendered template will be in JSON format, so it may be hard to parse.   

  ::

    # set Endpoint and User/Pass appropriately for your environment
    export RS_ENDPOINT="https://127.0.0.1:8092"
    export RS_KEY="rocketskates:r0cketsk8ts"

    # get your Job ID from the failed job, and set accordingly:
    JOBID="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    curl -k -u $RS_KEY $RS_ENDPOINT/api/v3/jobs/$JOBID/actions > $JOBID.json

    # optional - if you have the remarshal tools installed:
    json2yaml $JOBID.json > $JOBID.yaml


.. _rs_jq_examples:

JQ Usage Examples
-----------------

JQ Raw Mode
===========

Raw JSON output is usefull when passing the results of one ``jq`` command in to another for scripted interaction.  Be sure to specify "Raw" mode in this case - to prevent colorization and extraneous quotes being wrapped around Key/Value data output.
  ::

      <some command> | jq -r ...

.. _rs_filter_gohai:

Filter Out gohai-inventory
==========================

The ``gohai-inventory`` module is extremely useful for providing Machine classification information for use by other stages or tasks.  However, it is very long and causes a lot of content to be output to the console when listing Machine information.  Using a simple ``jq`` filter, you can delete the ``gohai-inventory`` content from the output display.

Note that since the Param name is ``gohai-inventory``, we have to provide some quoting of the Param name, since the dash (``-``) has special meaning in JSON parsing.
  ::

    drpcli machines list | jq 'del(.[].Params."gohai-inventory")'

Subsequently, if you are listing an individual Machine, then you can also filter it's ``gohai-inventory`` output as well, with:
  ::

    drpcli machines show <UUID> | jq 'del(.Params."gohai-inventory")'

List BootEnv Names
==================

Get list of bootenvs available in the installed content, by name:
  ::

    drpcli bootenvs list | jq '.[].Name'


Reformat Output With Specific Keys
==================================

Get list of machines, output "Name:Uuid" pairs from the the JSON output:
  ::

    drpcli machines list | jq -r '.[] | "\(.Name):\(.Uuid)"'

Output is printed as follows:
  ::

    machine1:05abe5dc-637a-4952-a1be-5ec85ba00686
    machine2:0d8b7684-9d0e-4c3e-9f89-eded02357521

You can modify the output separator (colon in this example) to suit your needs.


Extract Specific Key From Output
================================

``jq`` can also pull out only specific Keys from the JSON input.  Here is an example to get ISO File name for a bootenv:
  ::

    drpcli contents show os-discovery | jq '.sections.bootenvs.discovery.OS.IsoFile'


Display Job Logs for Specific Machine
=====================================

The Job Logs provide a lot of information about the provisioning process of your DRP Endpoint.  However, you often only want to see Job Logs for a specific Machine to evaluate provisioning status.  To get specific Jobs from the job list - based on Machine UUID, do:
  ::

    export UUID=`abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop-qrps"
    drpcli jobs list | jq ".[] | select(.Machine==\"$UUID\")"
