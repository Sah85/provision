Digital Rebar Provision Command Line Interface (CLI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Digital Rebar Provision Command Line Interface (drpcli) provides a simplified way to interact with the :ref:`rs_api`.  The command line tool (``drpcli``) is auto-generated from source code via reference of the API.  This means the CLI should implement 100% coverage of the API.

Overview
========

The CLI provides help for commands and follows a pattern of chained parameters with a few flags for additional
modifications.

Some examples are:

  ::

    drpcli bootenvs list
    drpcli subnets get mysubnet
    drpcli preferences set defaultBootEnv discovery


The *drpcli* has help at each layer of command and is the easiest way to figure out what can and can not be done.

  ::

    drpcli help
    drpcli bootenvs help


Each object in the :ref:`rs_data_architecture` has a CLI subcommand.

.. note:: VERY IMPORTANT - the **update** commands use the **PATCH** operation for the objects in the :ref:`rs_api`.  This has the implication that for map like components (Params sections of :ref:`rs_model_machine` and :ref:`rs_model_profile`) the contents are merged with the existing object.  For the Params sections specifically, use the subaction *params* to replace contents.

By default, the CLI will attempt to access the *dr-provision* API endpoint on the localhost at port 8092 with
the username and password of *rocketskates* and *r0cketsk8ts*, respectively.
All three of these values can be provided by environment variable or command line flag.

======== ==================== ================ ==============================================================
Option   Environment Variable Flag             Format
======== ==================== ================ ==============================================================
Username RS_KEY               -P or --password String, but when part of RS_KEY it is: username:password
Password RS_KEY               -U or --username String, but when part of RS_KEY it is: username:password
Token    RS_TOKEN             N/A              Base64 encoded string from a generate token API call.
Endpoint RS_ENDPOINT          -E or --endpoint URL for access, https://IP:PORT. e.g. https://127.0.0.1:8092
======== ==================== ================ ==============================================================

.. note:: It is necessary to specify either a username and password or a token.

Another useful flag is *--format*.  this will change the tool output to YAML instead of JSON.  This can
be helpful when editing files by hand.  e.g. *--format yaml*

For Bash users, the drpcli can generate its own bash completion file.  Once generated, it is necessary to restart
the terminal/shell or reload the completions.

.. admonition:: linux

  ::

    sudo drpcli autocomplete /etc/bash_completion.d/drpcli
    . /etc/bash_completion

.. admonition:: Darwin

  Assuming that Brew is in use to update and manage bash and bash autocompletion.

  ::

    sudo drpcli autocomplete /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/drpcli
    . /usr/local/etc/bash_completion
